<center><h1> Sack Golemba </h1> </center>
<center><p> As head coach of <b>JDCHS</b>, Goran Golemba has not been up to the task. He has been dissapointing since the very beginning. With a 1-6 start as the coach of the previous State champions, something is wrong. His inability to play players where they should and in position has been devastating. His leadership skills just aren't there. He has just not been able to keep up with the team, and has even previously admitted that he should not have taken the job.  </p></center>
